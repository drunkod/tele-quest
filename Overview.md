# Project Overview

Your project, `tele-quest` (as seen in `package.json`), appears to be a web application built with **Vue 3**, potentially leveraging **Jazz tools** for data management and collaboration. It uses **Vite** for development and building the project.

## Key Components

### Data Structure (`src/schema.ts`)

This file defines the data models using `jazz-tools`:

*   **Message:** Represents a single message with a `text` property (string).
*   **Chat:** Represents a collection of `Message` objects, possibly a chat log.

### Styling (`src/assets/base.css`)

Sets up basic styling for the application, including font, colors, and body styles. Uses CSS variables (`var(--color-text)`, etc.) for theme customization.

### Dependencies (`package.json`)

**Core Technologies:**

*   **Vue 3:** The JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
*   **Vue Router:** Enables navigation between different views/pages.
*   **Jazz tools, Jazz browser, Jazz vue:** Libraries likely for real-time data synchronization and collaboration features.

**Development Tools:**

*   **Vite:** A fast build tool for modern web development.
*   **TypeScript:** Provides static typing for JavaScript.
*   Various other tools for linting, formatting, and testing.

### Build and Development (`package.json`)

**Scripts:**

*   **dev:** Starts the development server using Vite.
*   **build:** Creates a production-ready build.
*   **preview:** Serves the built application locally.
*   Scripts for type checking, formatting, and linting.

## How It Works (Likely Flow)

1.  **Data Management:** The `schema.ts` file defines how your application's data (messages, chats) is structured using Jazz tools. Jazz likely provides mechanisms to store and synchronize this data.
2.  **User Interface:** Vue 3 is used to build the user interface. Components (likely in `.vue` files you haven't shared) define the structure and behavior of the app's UI elements.
3.  **Navigation:** Vue Router manages navigation between different sections of your application.
4.  **Collaboration (Potential):** Jazz libraries might enable real-time features, such as collaborative editing of chats or live updates of messages.
5.  **Development and Build:** Vite streamlines the development process with features like hot module reloading. The build script prepares your application for deployment.

## Additional Notes

### Missing Pieces

The shared information doesn't provide insights into the specific functionality or purpose of your application beyond the basic structure. To get a more complete understanding, we'd need to look at the Vue components and other code files.

### Jazz Tools

It would be helpful to refer to Jazz documentation to learn more about how it's being used in your project.

### IDX (If applicable)

If you are developing in IDX, you might consider leveraging the preview features to test your application easily. You can access the user guide for project IDX here: [https://developers.google.com/idx/guides/introduction](https://developers.google.com/idx/guides/introduction).
